The fifth assignment at Object Oriented Programming

An application written in C++ that offers 2 modes, admin and user.
The admin mode offers basic CRUD functionality plus filtering by a specific field of some objects (Trenchcoats in the current case).
The user mode offers the possibility to choose a coat based on size, eventually see a photo of it in the browser, and add it to a shopping basket

The target of this iteration was to learn working with different kinds of files. This is achieved by storing the repository in a text file, and the basket in either CSV format or HTML, at the choice of the user
