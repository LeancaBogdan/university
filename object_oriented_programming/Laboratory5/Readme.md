The fifth assignment at Object Oriented Programming

An application written in C++ that offers 2 modes, admin and user.
The admin mode offers basic CRUD functionality plus filtering by a specific field of some objects (Trenchcoats in the current case).
The user mode is presented in the next iteration, in Laboratory6

One of the targets of this project was to learn working with C++ objects.
